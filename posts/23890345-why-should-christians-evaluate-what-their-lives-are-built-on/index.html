As believers, we must recoginze the consequences of putting our trust in shaky ground. Ecclesiastes 12:6 warns, \"or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be shattered at the spring, or the wheel broken at the well, then shall both sons and daughters be companions, ready to entertain one another.\" The loss of these tangible symbols indicates the final separation of life's soul from the body. In the context of our existence, this underscores the need to ensure our real-world foundation—the building blocks of our belief system and values—is resilient and rooted firmly in God's precepts. This essay will underline why Christians evaluate what their lives are built on, as well as the processes and principles behind fortifying our foundations in faith.\nThe Importance of a Solid Foundation In Matthew 7:24-27, Jesus addresses the significance of laying the appropriate foundation when He states, \"Whosoever therefore shall be wise, and build their house upon a rock, the rains descended, and the floods came, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was foundde upon a rock. And every one that heareth these sayings of Mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and beat upon that house; and it fell immediately, and great was the fall thereof.\" This story emphasizes the critical importance of putting our trust in the eternal, unchanging truth of God’s Word, as opposed to the transient, fleeting sand of worldly pursuits. To reiterate, when it comes to evaluating what our lives are built on, we must assess whether our principles, actions, and core beliefs are founded on sound spiritual ground or flawed human reason.\nPotential Consequences of a Flawed Foundation Failure to examine the convictions underlying our lives can have disastrous consequences, including:\nMisplaced priorities: If we base decisions on the illusory ideals of fame, wealth, and pleasure, we risk losing the true, eternal purpose of our lives. Psalm 119:35 warns, \"Make thy sentence beautiful upon me, as it is thine own stability forever.\" God’s unwavering standard remains the only sound anchor for our lives.\nSpiritual emptiness: Embracing worldly values leaves us prone to emptiness and yearning, as echoed by the Psalmist in Psalm 73:25, \"Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.\" We need a genuine relationship with Christ to fill the void we may try to fill with superficial pursuits.\nLoss of character and integrity: If our values are eroded by worldly pressures, we risk the crumbling of our moral compass and personal witness for God. Proverbs 24:10 warns, \"If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.\" Wandering from the foundation of faith places our life and testimony on perilous ground.\nEstablishing a Solid Foundation Evaluating what our lives are built on necessitates honest self-assessment, accompanied by intentional efforts to secure a lasting, divinely-based foundation:\nDaily study of Scripture: A vital part of safeguarding our faith is nourishing it through constant communion with the Word. Psalm 119:105 admonishes us to \"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.\" God’s precepts guide us safely, just like a reliable light in a dark place.\nPrayer: Regular dialogue with God strengthens and aligns our hearts with His will. Romans 12:1-2 instructs us to offer ourselves wholly to God, setting aside the corrupt desires of our depraved nature and being transformed by His power. This is a necessary course of action to ensure we are built upon the proper spiritual ground.\nFellowship: It is imperative to surround ourselves with fellow believers who uplift and encourage us, fostering growth in the knowledge of Christ. Psalm 133:1 states, \"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!\" Building a meaningful community based on Christ can help us remain grounded in biblical truth.\nSubmission to divine authority: Being an obedient Christian ensures we stay firmly rooted in faith; James 4:7 urges us to \"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\" Humbled acceptance of God’s sovereignty guards against shifting sands and instability.\nA commitment to holiness: Romans 6:1-4 commands, \"Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?\" By rejecting sin, we plant our feet more firmly on the rock that is Christ.\nIn conclusion, evaluating the foundations of our lives as Christians necessitates daily assessment, reflection, and deliberate effort to remain anchored in God's Holy Word. By grounding ourselves in His truths, we ensure a fruitful, steadfast journey despite life’s storms and challenges. Solomon's admonition in Proverbs 4:26 underlines this obligation: \"Ponder the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established.\"\n","wordCount":"857","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-02-27T16:05:34Z","dateModified":"2024-02-27T16:05:34Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://asnickijmurat.github.io/posts/23890345-why-should-christians-evaluate-what-their-lives-are-built-on/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Asnickij Murat","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://asnickijmurat.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://asnickijmurat.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Asnickij Murat (Alt + H)">Asnickij Murat</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Why Should Christians Evaluate What Their Lives Are Built On?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-02-27 16:05:34 +0000 UTC'>February 27, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="The Importance of a Solid Foundation">The Importance of a Solid Foundation</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Potential Consequences of a Flawed Foundation">Potential Consequences of a Flawed Foundation</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Establishing a Solid Foundation">Establishing a Solid Foundation</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>A sturdy foundation is a metaphor that represents the solid framework for our lives, particularly from a Christian perspective.
