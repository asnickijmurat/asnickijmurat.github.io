But older Christians, though they've grown in their faith, still have much room for growth as well. Here are nine lessons that will help both types of followers of Christ.\n1. Our main purpose is to love God and love others. When Jesus was asked about the greatest commandment, He replied by combining Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18: \"'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments\" (Matthew 22:37–40, NIV). We can make loving God and our neighbors a priority without obsessing over rules, laws and traditions.\n2. The Holy Spirit helps us follow Christ. The Spirit serves as a \"helper\" (John 14:16, NIV) and a \"comforter\" (v. 18), teaching us, reminding us of Christ's teachings, and empowering us to do the things that pleas e Him. In other words, the Spirit helps us live Christian lives.\n3. Salvation isn't the end, but the beginning, of our walk with Christ. Getting saved is the starting point, but Christians are always works in progress. Instead of considering ourselves \"finished products,\" we should recognize the need for continual growth in grace, wisdom, and character.\n4. Our faith can't be separated from obedience and action. A living faith produces good works (James 2:17–18), a fact often forgotten by many Christians but not by outsiders. If people see us as uninvolved or uncaring, we're not demonstrating true Christian faith.\n5. Sin is real, but forgiveness is more so. God hates sin, but He loves sinners—and has provided a way of escape through Christ's death and resurrection (Romans 6:23, I Corinthians 15:56–57). When we confess sin, God is faithful to forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness (I John 1:9).\n6. It's okay to not have all the answers. A healthy faith doesn't require knowledge of every theological debate or issue; it simply involves a relationship with Christ, trust in His Word, and a willingness to serve. Belief and assurance don't come from perfect comprehension; they result from trust and reliance on our Creator.\n7. Trust and rest in God. In an age of self-reliance and do-it-yourself mania, we must remember our limited abilities in comparison to God's. He's sovereign, wise and powerful, a truth demonstrated many times in Scripture. We shouldn't be ashamed to call out to the Lord for help and wisdom.\n8. Eternal life begins at salvation, but its richness increases as we grow. New believers receive the assurance of eternal life through faith. Over time, as they grow in Christ, they experience a deeper intimacy with God, increased capacity for godly love and greater understanding of the Bible's meaning.\n9. Faith isn't a solo endeavor; it involves a body of believers. The Christian experience is meant to be lived in community. Fellowship with other believers gives support, guidance and a chance to put our faith into practice. Being part of a body of believers, the church, is a valuable part of our life in Christ.\nAdapted from Susan Mat録, Guideposts (www.guideposts.org). © 2010 Susan Matróc.
